# MARS - McNeese Augmented Reality Sandbox
The McNeeese Augmented Reality Sandbox is an interactive sandbox with an augmented-reality topology map and water simulation. This project is based on the original UC Davis AR sandbox.

### Differences between original UC Davis AR sandbox and MARS

MARS is currently using Linux Mint 19.3 (MATE desktop). Like the original, we are using a first-generation Kinect unit as the IR camera.

(Unverified) MARS is running on an HP Z4/Z6 Workstation, link [here](https://www8.hp.com/au/en/workstations/z440.html#!&pd1=1).

## Special documentation

* All USB devices must be plugged into the BACK of the computer tower, not in the front.
* Previous versions of the rig used a mirror, and a command was used to flip the screen display. Hopefully, the new rig won't require any mirrors, but for documentation's sake, the command(s) were listed here. https://askubuntu.com/questions/19936/how-can-i-mirror-flip-display-output 
* On Linux Mint 19.3 Mate, there is a freezing issue that occurs in the VRUI when holding down a key. Possible solutions include switching to 19.1 Mate, 19.3 Cinnamon, or editing the VRUI config to disable pointer grabbing. To disable pointer grabbing:
  * Edit the VRUI config:
    * `sudo nano /usr/local/etc/Vrui-4.6/Vrui.cfg`
  * Find the section called "MouseAdapter" and insert the following line: 
    * `grabPointer false`
  * Then save the file. 
* If getting an `"Interface 0 is already claimed"`,`"Error while setting alternate setting"`, or a LIBUSB error after hanging, see the following links:
